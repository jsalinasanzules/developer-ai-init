# Current State

- Date: 2026-11-04
- Stage: core contracts defined; moving through the approved task dependency graph.
- Repository: `jsalinasanzules/developer-ai-init`, public, default branch `main`.
- Personal GitHub read/write access verified.
- The foundation, nine specifications, eighteen task briefs, memory records, templates, and registry are committed.
- TASK-001 review: `docs/reviews/2026-11-04-task-001-foundation-review.md`.
- TASK-002 target-project layout: `docs/architecture/target-project-layout.md`.
- TASK-003 schemas: `schemas/README.md` and `schemas/*.schema.json`.
- TASK-004 memory protocol: `docs/architecture/memory-protocol.md`.

## Active task
**TASK-005 — Define decision log, conflict detection, and approval workflow**
- Status: ready; dependency TASK-004 is done.
- Specs: SPEC-004, SPEC-002.
- Next action: read the task brief and specify conflict classification, approval records, and decision lifecycle.

## Completed recently
- **TASK-001** (`done`): foundation review and OpenCode capability validation.
- **TASK-002** (`done`): canonical `.blueprint/` tree, file catalog, ownership, collision, and upgrade policies.
- **TASK-003** (`done`): versioned JSON schemas, fixtures, and cross-reference rules; 15/15 fixture expectations pass.
- **TASK-004** (`done`): deterministic startup read protocol, context packet, ownership map, write triggers, and compaction rules.

## Approved decisions
- **ADR-006:** V2-native OpenCode adapter baseline, with portable Markdown commands/skills where practical.
- **ADR-007:** opt-in depth-2 delegation (`experimental.subagent_depth: 2`) with sequential fallback.
- Pending future decision: initializer/validator implementation stack (needed before TASK-012/TASK-013).

## Verified constraints
- No mandatory database, hosted service, or network dependency.
- Canonical memory remains provider-independent and Git-native.
- Do not implement every phase automatically; follow task dependencies.
- Ask about conflicts and material decisions.
- Done requires observable verification evidence.
- OpenCode 1 and OpenCode 2 share the `opencode` command; this environment runs `v2.2.5`.
- OpenCode's default subagent depth is `1`; true Orchestrator → Manager → Specialist delegation requires depth `2` (experimental in V2) or the documented fallback.

## Blockers
None recorded.

## Next
Start TASK-005. After it completes, TASK-006 and TASK-007 become eligible; TASK-006 can run independently of TASK-005.
